# instagram-unfollow-checker
I did this because I don't want to give the apps that do this my username/password

## NOTE
Finish this later bc I almost got banned from Insta

## UPDATE
It should work. Users have to be logged in to insta and input the code into the console part in the developer console and make sure to change the "username" variable to their username in the JS file
